Hello {{ item.possible_owner.get_full_name }},

A lost and found item was turned in at the {{ item.location.long_name }} lab and we believe it may belong to you.

To claim an item valued over $50 or containing personal information:
1. Visit the Campus Public Safety Office (CPSO) on the ground floor of Shattuck Hall
2. Bring photo ID to show CPSO
3. Be able to accurately describe the item prior to pick up

Note: USB Drives will never be turned in to CPSO

To claim any other item:
1. Go to {{ item.location.long_name }}
2. Bring photo ID to show the lab attendant
3. Be able to accurately describe the item prior to pick up

Due to storage limitations, unclaimed lost items valued under $50 are kept for a week following reciept. Following the one-week retention period, unclaimed items are then donated to a charitable organization. You may visit our lab to see whether your valuable item has already been taken to CPSO.

Please do not reply to this message.
