# Change log for ITS Lost and Found

## 1.2.0 - unreleased

In progress...


## 1.1.0 - 2016-06-20

###Added

- Added an item status log page for non-admin users. This page was
  previously only available to admins and always included the admin
  actions form.

##Changed

- Changed the email text for possible owner notifications to be more
  informative including using the location's long name.



## 1.0.0 - 2016-05-02

Tagging this release as 1.0.0 is somewhat arbitrary. Previous versions
weren't tagged. Compared to earlier versions, this version has been
cleaned up, converted into a distutils package, and made deployable with
ARCTasks.

## Pre-1.0
